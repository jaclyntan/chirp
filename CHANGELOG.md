# Changelog

## v1.1.0 — 2026-09-19

### New

- **Paste last transcript**: an optional global shortcut (⌥V by default)
  that drops your most recent transcript wherever the cursor is. For when
  focus moved mid-dictation and the text landed somewhere else, or when
  Accessibility wasn't granted and it only reached the clipboard. Off by
  default, since it claims a global key combination.

### Fixed

- Global shortcuts no longer leak their own keystroke. An observe-only
  monitor can't consume an event, so ⌥V fired the paste *and* typed `√`
  into your text; Notetaker's ⌥M did the same with `µ`. Both now use a
  `CGEvent` tap that swallows the keystroke.
- A shortcut enabled before Accessibility was granted stayed dead until
  the next relaunch — the tap now starts the moment the grant lands.
- Onboarding never re-checked permissions, so granting Accessibility in
  System Settings left the step showing "Allow" indefinitely.
- Onboarding now offers Reset & Relaunch for a grant recorded against an
  older build's signature — previously only reachable from Settings.
- The microphone test now shows a real level meter and confirms when it
  has heard you; the only live feedback before was a subtle scale pulse
  on a sprite that animates regardless.
- The live preview is styled as provisional text, since it comes from a
  different model and hasn't been through the cleanup pipeline.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-09-19

First release of Chirp. Private, on-device voice dictation for macOS.

Chirp began as a fork of [Murmur](https://github.com/janisbelozerovs-dev/murmur)
and has diverged substantially since — several recognition engines and a
number of features were removed, and the interface was rebuilt. Version
numbering restarts here; the 2.x tags belong to the project it came from.

### Dictation

- Push-to-talk on `fn` (or right ⌥) anywhere, double-tap for hands-free.
- Apple's on-device SpeechAnalyzer. No model download, works offline.
- Cleanup pipeline: filler removal, spoken "new line"/"new paragraph",
  auto-capitalisation, personal dictionary, snippet expansion. Terminals
  and code editors get your exact words, untouched.
- Harper grammar pass — deterministic, local, no model.
- Corrections you make in History are learned and bias future recognition.
- Starter dictionary and snippet sets, both restorable and bulk-removable.

### The wren

- A floating desktop companion that reacts to what the app is doing, and
  can wander and fly around the screen on its own — or be pinned in place.
- Dictations started from its mic button show the transcript in a speech
  bubble you can copy, edit or discard from, without opening the window.
- Optional live transcript while you speak, in the bubble and in the
  floating status pill. Off by default: it downloads a ~220 MB streaming
  model the first time it runs, the only download Chirp ever makes beyond
  macOS's own speech assets.

### Notetaker

- Captures a call from your mic and the meeting app's own audio, separates
  speakers, and writes up a transcript locally. Optional on-device summary
  per note, with title, decisions and action items.

### Also

- Opens at login, optionally.
- Errors surface on the wren and as a banner in the window, rather than as
  small text in a corner.

## Unreleased — earlier development

### New

- **Notetaker**: on-device meeting notes. Detects an in-progress meeting via
  your calendar or (optionally) your browser's active tab, captures mic +
  system audio, transcribes and corrects it through the same Harper/
  dictionary pipeline as regular dictation, and generates a title, summary,
  decisions, and action items. Notes can be renamed, have action items
  checked off, and copied as one formatted block. Hide-from-screen-capture,
  auto-stop when the call ends, a configurable max recording length, and
  its own rebindable hotkey (⌥M by default).
- **Custom Transforms**: create your own ⌥-triggered rewrite shortcuts
  alongside the built-in Polish (⌥1) and Prompt Engineer (⌥2) — up to seven
  more, auto-assigned ⌥3–⌥9. A new card grid replaces the old plain list,
  with "Reset to defaults" and an ⌥⇧Z to undo the last transform via the
  target app's own ⌘Z.
- **Cleanup levels** on the Style page (Light / Concise) — a second axis
  alongside tone, for trimming wordiness independent of how formal the
  rewrite sounds.
- Snippets now track a per-snippet usage count, and the page leads with a
  "try something like" example card teaching what a snippet can do,
  including using one as a saved rewrite prompt.

### Changed

- Settings is now organized into collapsible accordion tiles (General,
  Dictation, Notetaker, Privacy & Permissions), matching the Help page's
  layout instead of one long scrolling list. The version/update status
  only shows its orange highlight when an update is actually available.
- The floating HUD dropped its live-transcript preview text — a different,
  lower-quality model than whichever engine you've actually selected,
  often late or wrong before the real transcript replaced it — down to a
  simpler icon + waveform + status-label footer.

## v2.1.0 — 2026-09-10

Dictation language support now actually works end-to-end — the language
picker, the recognition engines, and every post-processing step agree with
each other, which they didn't before. Also a warm-palette redesign across
most of the app.

### New

- **Fourth recognition engine**: Parakeet, NVIDIA's TDT model running via
  [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) (Core ML on
  the Neural Engine) — Chirp's fastest engine yet, in two sizes (English
  v2, multilingual v3). Vocabulary biasing isn't available for it yet,
  unlike the two Whisper engines.
- **Dedicated Latvian model**: a whisper.cpp option running the University
  of Latvia AI Lab's Interspeech 2025 fine-tune of Whisper large-v3 —
  3.2% word error rate on Latvian versus Parakeet v3's 22.84%.
- Settings' language picker now reflects whichever recognition engine and
  model is actually selected, instead of always showing Apple's fixed
  on-device locale list regardless of engine.
- GitHub Releases-based update checking on the Software settings page —
  no auto-installer, "Update Now" opens the release in your browser.

### Fixed

- Harper's grammar pass, personal "learned corrections," your dictionary,
  and the Apple Intelligence cleanup pass all ran unconditionally on every
  dictation regardless of language — for anything other than English, they
  silently "corrected" real words toward English ones. All four now only
  run when the dictation language is English.
- Switching to an English-only model (Parakeet v2, Distil-Whisper) and
  back used to leave you stuck on English afterward instead of restoring
  your actual language.
- Parakeet v3's language list is cut from the 25 NVIDIA documents down to
  the 10 FluidAudio's own benchmark measures under 10% word error rate —
  the rest weren't accurate enough to offer without a real fix (see the
  Latvian model above for the one language that got one).
- Settings dropdown panels (Recognition engine, model pickers, Language)
  could clip against the bottom of the window at its default size, or
  float away from their own trigger instead of opening right above/below
  it — root cause was a SwiftUI environment value silently resolving to
  `nil` one level higher in the view hierarchy than it needed to.
- The Dictation key picker now matches the same dropdown style as every
  other control on the Settings page, instead of an older, plainer one.

### Changed

- Warm-palette redesign across Home, Ask Chirp, Scratchpad, Style,
  Templates, Transforms, Voice Profile, Dictionary, Snippets, Insights,
  Help, Legal, and App Profiles.

## v2.0.1 — 2026-08-25

Fixes for the floating nav-bar HUD (the small pill that appears near the
bottom of the screen while Chirp is idle).

### Fixed

- Its popovers (Templates/Transforms, More, Listen) could render with their
  rounded corners and shadow sheared off flat, or clipped on one side —
  the panel they draw into was a fixed size too small for their actual
  content.
- Moving the cursor from a popover's trigger icon into the popover itself
  could close it before you reached it, since there was a real screen gap
  between the two with no hover coverage.
- At idle, the HUD's hit-region was the full nav-bar footprint (invisible,
  but still solid) — enough to swallow clicks meant for another
  bottom-docked utility sitting in the same part of the screen. Idle state
  now shows a small reveal-pill with a much smaller footprint, which grows
  into the full bar only when you hover it.
- The reveal/collapse between the small pill and the full bar is now a
  smooth, staged grow/shrink instead of an instant swap.

## v2.0.0 — 2026-08-23

The first public update since the original release — a full redesign, built and
open-sourced under MIT.

### New

- **Third recognition engine**: whisper.cpp running via Metal on the GPU,
  alongside Apple's built-in SpeechAnalyzer and WhisperKit. Chirp's fastest
  engine.
- **Harper grammar pass**: a deterministic, local, millisecond-speed grammar
  and style check that runs alongside the Apple Intelligence edit pass —
  catches agreement, punctuation, and repeated words the LLM edit occasionally
  misses. No model, no warm-up, no network.
- **Per-app profiles**: one place to set what Chirp does when you dictate
  into a specific app — tone and note template together, replacing two
  separate override systems that used to answer that question differently.
- **Ask Chirp**: ask questions about your own dictation history, answered
  entirely on-device via keyword retrieval into the local model.
- **Note templates**: restructure a transcript into a specific document shape
  via the on-device LLM; trigger one by voice at the start of a dictation.
- **Guided first run**: welcome → permissions → recognition engine → hotkey
  → mic test, shown once.
- **Hallucination filtering** for Whisper-family engines — phrase-matches the
  small, well-documented set of sign-off hallucinations ("Thank you.", etc.)
  those models produce on near-silent audio.
- **Legal page**: in-app licensing info for Chirp itself and its four
  open-source dependencies (also now in [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md)).

### Changed

- Full UI redesign — a multi-view dashboard (Home, Insights, Ask Chirp,
  Scratchpad, Dictionary, Voice Profile, Style, Snippets, Templates,
  Transforms, Settings) replacing the original single menu-bar view.
- Chirp is now open-source under MIT. Between this release and the last, it
  was developed as a closed-source commercial product; that plan was dropped
  in favor of open-sourcing the whole thing.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-07-20

Initial public release: push-to-talk dictation via Apple's on-device speech
recognition or WhisperKit, cleanup pipeline, pronunciation learning, Styles,
Transforms, and a dashboard with history and usage stats.
